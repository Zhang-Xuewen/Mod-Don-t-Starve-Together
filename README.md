A collection of the mods developed for Don't Starve Together by QiYuan (Xuewen Zhang).

I used to be a super fan of **Don't Starve Together** and **Don't Starve**. At that time, I made several mods for them just for fun.

The corresponding codes may be uploaded to this project.

> Once you activate the electronic module which means you need to have the power to make the module work, even if you deactive the module which means you take it off the effect will also remain. Notice: you can add at most 40 movespeed modules after that it will crash. I think 40 movespeed modules are enough already and your speed will reach 5.1 times.
